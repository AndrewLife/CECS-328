BINARY AND LINEAR SEARCH ALGORITHM

Goal: Demonstrate Binary and Linear Search Algorithms

This program begins by asking user to enter a number for the size of an array.
The array will be filled with random values from -1000 to 1000.
A random element in the array will be selected to be Key Value.
Bubble Sort Method is called to sort the array in ascending order.
Binary and Linear Search Methods are called to return the position(index) of key value in sorted array.

I then went on to calculate the average running time of each function in nanoseconds with 5000 elements in each array 30 times.
AKA:
5000 elements each array, 30 arrays for each search function.
