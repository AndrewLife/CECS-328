QUICKSORT AND INSERTION ALGORITHM

Goal: Demonstrate QuickSort and Insertion Sort

1. Ask User for the number of elements in an array

2. Random values from -7000 to 7000 will be stored in the array

3. Quick Sort Method is called to sort the array.

4. Random array is created and Insertion Sort method is called.

5. Each method is called 30 times each and with each time creating a new randomized array.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Through each Sorting algorithm, a sum of nanoseconds is calculated to show the average running time for function.

Finally, the program will calculate the maximum number of lines an Insertion Sort can run in one second.
